## [1.0.4]

### Added

- **Theme discovery API**: Comprehensive theme management with custom theme support and genre filtering.
- **Image processing options**: New CLI flags for image quality, dimensions, and format conversion control.

### Improved
- Font embedding now includes automatic subsetting to reduce file sizes and licensing warnings.
- Image processing with modern format conversion (WebP/AVIF) for better compression.
- Theme selection enhanced with `--list-themes` command and genre-based filtering.
- Graceful fallbacks when optional dependencies (fontTools, Pillow) are unavailable.

### Technical
- Created `fonts.py` module with character analysis and font subsetting capabilities.
- Created `images.py` module with comprehensive image optimization pipeline.

## [1.0.3]

### Added
- **Arbitrary ToC depth support**: Table of contents now supports heading depths from 1-6 levels (h1 through h6), extending beyond the previous h1/h2 limitation.
- **Mixed split strategy**: New `--split-at mixed` option with `--mixed-split-pattern` allows flexible content splitting (e.g., "h1,pagebreak" or "h1:main,pagebreak:appendix").
- **Enhanced heading level splitting**: Added support for splitting content at h3, h4, h5, and h6 heading levels.
- **Per-section start markers**: New `--reader-start-chapter` option allows specifying which chapter should be the reader's starting point in EPUB landmarks.

### Improved
- ToC generation now properly handles hierarchical heading structures with configurable depth limits.
- EPUB navigation supports deeper nesting for complex document structures.
- Heading ID generation creates proper hierarchical identifiers for multi-level documents.
- Reader start point can be customized instead of defaulting to first chapter.

### Technical
- Enhanced `_inject_heading_ids` function to process arbitrary heading depths.
- Added `split_html_by_heading_level` and `split_html_mixed` functions for flexible content splitting.
- Updated `BuildOptions` dataclass with new fields for mixed splitting and reader start configuration.
- Improved ToC assembly logic to handle variable-depth heading structures.

## [1.0.2]

### Added
- **Robust DOCX fallback parser**: Enhanced DOCX processing with improved support for tracked changes, comments, complex tables, text boxes, shapes, and equations when Pandoc is not available.
- **Advanced style mapping system**: Comprehensive styles.json configuration with user-override support. Users can now place custom styles.json files in their document directory or working directory to override default Word style â†’ HTML mappings.
- **Rasterize-on-escape feature**: Optional image fallback system for complex layout elements that cannot be cleanly translated to HTML, preserving author intention through visual placeholders.

### Improved
- DOCX fallback parser now handles insertions, deletions, and move operations from Word's track changes feature.
- Comment processing with visual indicators and tooltip text extraction.
- Table processing with better structure preservation and error handling.
- Extended paragraph and character style mappings covering more Word built-in styles.
- Better handling of figures, captions, equations, and code blocks.
