# Docx2Shelf Roadmap

> **Vision**  
> Make Docx2Shelf the most *reliable, standards‚Äëcompliant, and author‚Äëfriendly* DOCX‚ÜíEPUB tool‚Äîequally comfortable in a one‚Äëclick GUI flow and in large automated pipelines.

---

## Guiding principles
- **Quality first:** clean XHTML, predictable structure, strong accessibility and validation by default.
- **Offline by default:** zero network calls unless explicitly enabled (e.g., optional connectors).
- **Composable:** core + plugins + themes‚Äîsmall pieces, loosely coupled.
- **Reproducible:** same input ‚Üí same output across OSes and versions.
- **Secure supply chain:** verified downloads, signed releases, SBOM, reproducible builds.

---

## Completed (v1.1.x)
The following large items are **done** and form the new baseline:
- Robust DOCX fallback parser: tracked changes, comments, complex tables, text boxes/shapes, equations, headers/footers, footnotes/endnotes.
- Style mapping via user‚Äëoverridable `styles.json`.
- ‚ÄúRasterize‚Äëon‚Äëescape‚Äù for untranslatable layout elements.
- ToC & splitting: arbitrary ToC depth (‚â•3), mixed split strategies, per‚Äësection start markers.
- Theme packs & theme API (beyond serif/sans/printlike). Night‚Äëmode friendly base themes.
- Font subsetting via fontTools with licensing warnings.
- Image pipeline: resize/compress, long‚Äëedge caps, WebP/AVIF with fallback, per‚Äëimage DPI rules.
- Accessibility pass: alt‚Äëtext prompts, ARIA landmarks, accessibility metadata.
- **EPUBCheck runs by default** (opt‚Äëout); friendly summary with actionable hints.
- Language/script support: RTL, CJK/vertical options, hyphenation dictionaries; language‚Äëaware defaults.
- EPUB 2 compatibility mode (stricter CSS, dual nav/NCX).
- UX & workflow: `--preview` (pre‚Äëzip local viewer), `--inspect`, profiles `--profile kdp|kobo|apple|generic`.
- Batch mode and machine‚Äëreadable logs (`--json`) for CI.
- Richer `metadata.txt` schema (roles, BISAC/keywords normalization, series anchors) + retailer lints.
- First‚Äëparty GitHub Action (matrix builds, artifacts, EPUBCheck reports).
- Plugin hooks (pre‚Äëconvert, transforms, metadata resolvers).
- Optional offline‚Äëfirst connectors (local MD‚ÜíEPUB; gated cloud imports as opt‚Äëin packages).
- Distribution: PyPI (`pipx`), Homebrew, winget, Scoop, Docker image.
- Signed tool downloads with SHA‚Äë256 verification; GPG available.
- Tools Manager polish: version pin sets, `tools doctor`, offline bundles.
- Tests & QA: golden EPUB fixtures, property‚Äëbased tests, reader smoke tests.
- Docs: screenshots/GIFs, ‚Äúquality cookbook,‚Äù theme gallery, starter metadata templates.
- Governance: LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, Code of Conduct, issue templates & ‚Äúgood first issue‚Äù board.
