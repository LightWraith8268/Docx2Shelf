## GitHub Release Notes

Automatically generated release notes include:
- Version and milestone information
- Feature highlights
- Installation instructions
- Links to documentation
- Full changelog reference

## Prerequisites

### For GitHub Actions
- Repository write permissions
- GitHub CLI access
- Valid `GITHUB_TOKEN`

### For Manual Script
- Python 3.11+
- Git configured with user credentials
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Repository write access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Git authentication errors:**
```bash
# Configure Git credentials
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Or use GitHub CLI
gh auth login
```

**Version format errors:**
- Use semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Examples: `1.2.8`, `2.0.0`, `1.3.0`

**Missing features in release:**
- Ensure features are properly comma-separated
- Use quotes for features with spaces
- Verify feature descriptions are clear and user-focused

### Rollback Process

If a release needs to be rolled back:

1. **Delete the GitHub release:**
   ```bash
   gh release delete v1.2.8 --yes
   ```

2. **Revert the commit:**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```

3. **Update version back:**
   ```bash
   # Manually edit pyproject.toml or run script with previous version
   ```

## Best Practices

### Before Release
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Features tested thoroughly
- [ ] Breaking changes documented

### Feature Descriptions
- Use present tense ("Adds", not "Added")
- Focus on user benefits
- Be specific and actionable
- Include technical details in CHANGELOG

### Version Planning
- Plan versions in ROADMAP.md
- Keep milestones focused
- Communicate breaking changes clearly
- Maintain backward compatibility when possible

## Integration with CI/CD

The automated release process integrates with:
- **PyPI Publishing**: Automatically triggered after release
- **Docker Builds**: New images built for releases
- **Documentation Deployment**: Docs updated with new version
- **Package Managers**: Homebrew, winget, Scoop updated

## Security Considerations

- Release workflow requires explicit approval
- All commits are signed and verified
- Dependencies are pinned and verified
- Secrets are properly managed in GitHub
