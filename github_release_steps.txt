## Steps to Create a GitHub Release and Upload Assets

This guide will walk you through creating a new release on GitHub and attaching the `install.bat` file and the Python Wheel (`.whl`) as release assets.

**Important:** The `install.bat` script now relies on the `.whl` file being available as a release asset. You must perform the build step and upload the `.whl` file for each release.

1.  **Build the Python Wheel (`.whl`) file:**
    *   Open your terminal in the root directory of your project.
    *   Ensure you have the `build` package installed: `pip install build`
    *   Run the build command: `python -m build`
    *   The generated `.whl` file will be located in the `dist/` directory (e.g., `dist/docx2shelf-1.0.1-py3-none-any.whl`).

2.  **Go to your GitHub Repository:**
    *   Open your web browser and navigate to your Docx2Shelf repository on GitHub (e.g., `https://github.com/LightWraith8268/Docx2Shelf`).

3.  **Navigate to Releases:**
    *   On your repository's main page, look for the "Releases" section. It's usually on the right sidebar or under the "Code" tab, then "Releases". Click on it.

4.  **Draft a New Release:**
    *   You should see the latest tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`) listed. Click on the "Draft a new release" button.
    *   In the "Tag version" dropdown, select the appropriate tag (e.g., `v1.0.1`).
    *   For "Release title," you can put something like "Docx2Shelf v1.0.1 - Patch Release".
    *   In the "Description" box, you can copy the content of your `CHANGELOG.md` entry for the corresponding version, or a summary of it.

5.  **Upload Assets:**
    *   Scroll down to the "Assets" section.
    *   You can drag and drop your local `install.bat` file and the generated `.whl` file (from the `dist/` directory) into this area, or click "Add binaries by dragging & dropping or selecting them."
    *   Select both `install.bat` and the `.whl` file.

6.  **Publish Release:**
    *   Review all the details.
    *   If everything looks correct, click the "Publish release" button.

Once you've completed these steps, `install.bat` and the `.whl` file will be available for download directly from your GitHub release page, making it easy for users to get started with your tool.
